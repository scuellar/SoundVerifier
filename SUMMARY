Practical Multithreaded Verification Down to Bare Metal.

This project aims to create a tool that proves correctness
of annotated multithreaded C programs with respect to its execution
on real hardware (e.g. x86). Our approach is to create a fully
verified toolchain by connecting a VCC-like verifier to a correct
compiler like CompCert. The two short term goals of the summer
wherem (1) to explore the feasability of a verifier with respect to
the concurrent Clight semantics and (2) produce a minimal verifier,
proven sound w.r.t the Clight semantics. The long term goal is to
produce a practical verifier with the flexibility of VCC proved sound
w.r.t the concurrent Clight semantics.
