Practical Multithreaded Verification Down to Bare Metal.

This project aims to create a tool that proves correctness
of annotated multithreaded C programs with respect to their execution
on real hardware (e.g. x86). Our approach is to create a fully
verified toolchain by connecting a verified VCC-like verifier to
a fully verified compiler, such as concurrent-CompCert. For the
scope of the internship, I
(1) produced a verifier for a portion of the C language,
(2) gave it semantics compatible with CompCert's Clight and
(3) produced a machine checked correctness proof of the verifier.
